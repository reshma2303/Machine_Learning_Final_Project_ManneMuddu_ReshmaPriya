**Problem: Intrusion Detection (Finding Anamolies) Analysis**

The KDD Cup 1999 dataset has been chosen for this data analysis project. This dataset was used in the fifth international conference for the data mining and knowledge discovery competition and contains a huge variety of network intrusion data that is simulated in an environment equipped with a military network setting.

KDD Cup 1999 dataset will be used to build a machine learning based intrusion detection problem to predict (classify) whether a network connection is "normal" or "abnormal". As this is a categorical prediction, this is a binary classification problem

The original source of the dataset is from the official KDD website (http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) and can also be found in the kaggle website. The dataset contains about 494,000 records of network readings with details like source bytes, destination connection information, type of attacks and so on. Below are the list of features (columns) and their data types in the dataset.
